# MirrorMe
    Welcome to MirrorMe! MirrorMe is a tool designed to help effectively enhance the virtual learning experience of physical actions. This interactive application allows users to     join live sessions under either the role of student or teacher. Teachers are able to track and record specific movements, which they can then send live to multiple students.      Students can then learn the movement with personalized, guided feedback in the form of both on-screen tracking and haptic feedback from a device worn on the wrist.
