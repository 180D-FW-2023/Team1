This folder contains all the pages of our frontend and GUI using streamlit. components/ contains assets we used in our pages, and pages/ contains all pages that the user can navigate to. Streamlit requires the home page to be in this directory, and all other pages to be in the pages/ folder. One bug that occurs someone when the user navigates to the teacher or student start pages is that the model cached by TFHub throws an error for being the wrong size. We aren't sure why this bug occurs, and it its pretty rare, but the fix it just to navigate to the directory where the model is cached and delete it; on the next run of the program, the model will be redownloaded the correct size. One feature improvement we would like to make is to increase video stream replay along with the 2D movement, so it is easier for the student to follow along with the teacher's motion.
