The folder contains data and programs related to our network latency test between Bluetooth, MQTT using the free broker, and MQTT using our own hosted broker. brokerfree.csv contains the round trip time between our laptop and the Raspberry Pi using the free MQTT broker in seconds. brokerlaptop.csv contains the RTT in seconds using our own broker, and btl.csv contains the RTT in s using Bluetooth. As expected, Bluetooth is twice as fast as using MQTT. One bug is that we couldn't get Bluetooth to work on the M1 Mac, since the built-in Bluetooth driver had issues and wasn't easy to work with. The feature we would like to implement is to get Bluetooth device-discovery working on Mac, since it would cut down the latency significantly compared to MQTT.
