This folder contains all code and libraries related to the program that runs on the Raspberry Pi in the MirrorModule. The IMU related code is from BerryIMU: https://github.com/ozzmaker/BerryIMU
One bug with the code in this folder is that sometimes the buzzer will continue to buzz if the application crashes or is closed not using the exit buttons in the front-end. Another bug is that sometimes the buzzer will trigger the IMU's double-tap feature, but this is probably related to the fact that our IMU wasn't properly secured on our module. A feature improvement we would like to make is to add a microphone onto the Pi for voice recognition, and use voice recognition as an interface to the application.
